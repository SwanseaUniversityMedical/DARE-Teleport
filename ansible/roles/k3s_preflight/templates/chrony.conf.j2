# This directive tells chrony to regulate the real-time clock and tells it
# Where to store related data.  It may not work on some newer motherboards
# that use the HPET real-time clock.  It requires enhanced real-time
# support in the kernel.  I've commented it out because with certain
# combinations of motherboard and kernel it is reported to cause lockups.

# If the last line of this file reads 'rtconutc' chrony will assume that
# the CMOS clock is on UTC (GMT).  If it reads '# rtconutc' or is absent
# chrony will assume local time.  The line (if any) was written by the
# chrony postinst based on what it found in /etc/default/rcS.  You may
# change it if necessary.
